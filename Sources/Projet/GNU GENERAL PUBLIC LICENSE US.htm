lang=EN-GB>                      Version 2, June 1991</span></pre><pre><span
lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></pre><pre><span lang=EN-GB> Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.</span></pre><pre><span
lang=EN-GB>                       </span>59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA  02111-1307  USA</pre><pre> <span
lang=EN-GB>Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies</span></pre><pre><span
lang=EN-GB> of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.</span></pre><pre><span
lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></pre><pre><span lang=EN-GB>                           Preamble</span></pre><pre><span
lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></pre><pre><span lang=EN-GB>  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your</span></pre><pre><span
lang=EN-GB>freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public</span></pre><pre><span
lang=EN-GB>License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free</span></pre><pre><span
lang=EN-GB>software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This</span></pre><pre><span
lang=EN-GB>General Public License applies to most of the Free Software</span></pre><pre><span
lang=EN-GB>Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to</span></pre><pre><span
lang=EN-GB>using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by</span></pre><pre><span
lang=EN-GB>the GNU Library General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to</span></pre><pre><span
lang=EN-GB>your programs, too.</span></pre><pre><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></pre><pre><span
lang=EN-GB>  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not</span></pre><pre><span
lang=EN-GB>price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you</span></pre><pre><span
lang=EN-GB>have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for</span></pre><pre><span
lang=EN-GB>this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it</span></pre><pre><span
lang=EN-GB>if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it</span></pre><pre><span
lang=EN-GB>in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.</span></pre><pre><span
lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></pre><pre><span lang=EN-GB>  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid</span></pre><pre><span
lang=EN-GB>anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.</span></pre><pre><span
lang=EN-GB>These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you</span></pre><pre><span
lang=EN-GB>distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.</span></pre><pre><span
lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></pre><pre><span lang=EN-GB>  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether</span></pre><pre><span
lang=EN-GB>gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that</span></pre><pre><span
lang=EN-GB>you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the</span></pre><pre><span
lang=EN-GB>source code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their</span></pre><pre><span
lang=EN-GB>rights.</span></pre><pre><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></pre><pre><span
lang=EN-GB>  We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and</span></pre><pre><span
lang=EN-GB>(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,</span></pre><pre><span
lang=EN-GB>distribute and/or modify the software.</span></pre><pre><span
lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></pre><pre><span lang=EN-GB>  Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain</span></pre><pre><span
lang=EN-GB>that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free</span></pre><pre><span
lang=EN-GB>software.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we</span></pre><pre><span
lang=EN-GB>want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so</span></pre><pre><span
lang=EN-GB>that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original</span></pre><pre><span
lang=EN-GB>authors' reputations.</span></pre><pre><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></pre><pre><span
lang=EN-GB>  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software</span></pre><pre><span
lang=EN-GB>patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free</span></pre><pre><span
lang=EN-GB>program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the</span></pre><pre><span
lang=EN-GB>program proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any</span></pre><pre><span
lang=EN-GB>patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.</span></pre><pre><span
lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></pre><pre><span lang=EN-GB>  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and</span></pre><pre><span
lang=EN-GB>modification follow.</span></pre><pre><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></pre><pre><span
lang=EN-GB>                   GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE</span></pre><pre><span
lang=EN-GB>   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION</span></pre><pre><span
lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></pre><pre><span lang=EN-GB>  0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains</span></pre><pre><span
lang=EN-GB>a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed</span></pre><pre><span
lang=EN-GB>under the terms of this General Public License.  The &quot;Program&quot;, below,</span></pre><pre><span
lang=EN-GB>refers to any such program or work, and a &quot;work based on the Program&quot;</span></pre><pre><span
lang=EN-GB>means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:</span></pre><pre><span
lang=EN-GB>that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,</span></pre><pre><span
lang=EN-GB>either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another</span></pre><pre><span
lang=EN-GB>language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in</span></pre><pre><span
lang=EN-GB>the term &quot;modification&quot;.)  Each licensee is addressed as &quot;you&quot;.</span></pre><pre><span
lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></pre><pre><span lang=EN-GB>Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not</span></pre><pre><span
lang=EN-GB>covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of</span></pre><pre><span
lang=EN-GB>running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program</span></pre><pre><span
lang=EN-GB>is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the</span></pre><pre><span
lang=EN-GB>Program (independent of having been made by running the Program).</span></pre><pre><span
lang=EN-GB>Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.</span></pre><pre><span
lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></pre><pre><span lang=EN-GB>  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's</span></pre><pre><span
lang=EN-GB>source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you</span></pre><pre><span
lang=EN-GB>conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate</span></pre><pre><span
lang=EN-GB>copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the</span></pre><pre><span
lang=EN-GB>notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;</span></pre><pre><span
lang=EN-GB>and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License</span></pre><pre><span
lang=EN-GB>along with the Program.</span></pre><pre><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></pre><pre><span
lang=EN-GB>You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and</span></pre><pre><span
lang=EN-GB>you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.</span></pre><pre><span
lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></pre><pre><span lang=EN-GB>  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion</span></pre><pre><span
lang=EN-GB>of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and</span></pre><pre><span
lang=EN-GB>distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1</span></pre><pre><span
lang=EN-GB>above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:</span></pre><pre><span
lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></pre><pre><span lang=EN-GB>    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices</span></pre><pre><span
lang=EN-GB>    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.</span></pre><pre><span
lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></pre><pre><span lang=EN-GB>    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in</span></pre><pre><span
lang=EN-GB>    whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any</span></pre><pre><span
lang=EN-GB>    part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third</span></pre><pre><span
lang=EN-GB>    parties under the terms of this License.</span></pre><pre><span
lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></pre><pre><span lang=EN-GB>    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively</span></pre><pre><span
lang=EN-GB>    when run, you must cause it, when started running for such</span></pre><pre><span
lang=EN-GB>    interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an</span></pre><pre><span
lang=EN-GB>    announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a</span></pre><pre><span
lang=EN-GB>    notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide</span></pre><pre><span
lang=EN-GB>    a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under</span></pre><pre><span
lang=EN-GB>    these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this</span></pre><pre><span
lang=EN-GB>    License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but</span></pre><pre><span
lang=EN-GB>    does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on</span></pre><pre><span
lang=EN-GB>    the Program is not required to print an announcement.)</span></pre><pre><span
lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></pre><pre><span lang=EN-GB>These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If</span></pre><pre><span
lang=EN-GB>identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,</span></pre><pre><span
lang=EN-GB>and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in</span></pre><pre><span
lang=EN-GB>themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those</span></pre><pre><span
lang=EN-GB>sections when you distribute them as separate works.  </span>But when you</pre><pre>distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based</pre><pre>on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of</pre><pre>this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the</pre><pre>entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.</pre><pre>&nbsp;</pre><pre>Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest</pre><pre>your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to</pre><pre>exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or</pre><pre>collective works based on the Program.</pre><pre>&nbsp;</pre><pre>In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program</pre><pre>with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of</pre><pre>a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under</pre><pre>the scope of this License.</pre><pre>&nbsp;</pre><pre>  3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,</pre><pre>under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of</pre><pre>Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:</pre><pre>&nbsp;</pre><pre>    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable</pre><pre>    source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections</pre><pre>    1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,</pre><pre>&nbsp;</pre><pre>    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three</pre><pre>    years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your</pre><pre>    cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete</pre><pre>    machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be</pre><pre>    distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium</pre><pre>    customarily used for software interchange; or,</pre><pre>&nbsp;</pre><pre>    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer</pre><pre>    to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is</pre><pre>    allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you</pre><pre>    received the program in object code or executable form with such</pre><pre>    an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)</pre><pre>&nbsp;</pre><pre>The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for</pre><pre>making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source</pre><pre>code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any</pre><pre>associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to</pre><pre>control compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a</pre><pre>special exception, the source code distributed need not include</pre><pre>anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary</pre><pre>form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the</pre><pre>operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component</pre><pre>itself accompanies the executable.</pre><pre>&nbsp;</pre><pre>If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering</pre><pre>access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent</pre><pre>access to copy the source code from the same place counts as</pre><pre>distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not</pre><pre>compelled to copy the source along with the object code.</pre><pre>&nbsp;</pre><pre>  4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program</pre><pre>except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt</pre><pre>otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is</pre><pre>void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.</pre><pre>However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under</pre><pre>this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such</pre><pre>parties remain in full compliance.</pre><pre>&nbsp;</pre><pre>  5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not</pre><pre>signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or</pre><pre>distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are</pre><pre>prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by</pre><pre>modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the</pre><pre>Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and</pre><pre>all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying</pre><pre>the Program or works based on it.</pre><pre>&nbsp;</pre><pre>  6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the</pre><pre>Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the</pre><pre>original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to</pre><pre>these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further</pre><pre>restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.</pre><pre>You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to</pre><pre>this License.</pre><pre>&nbsp;</pre><pre>  7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent</pre><pre>infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),</pre><pre>conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or</pre><pre>otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not</pre><pre>excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot</pre><pre>distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this</pre><pre>License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you</pre><pre>may not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent</pre><pre>license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by</pre><pre>all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then</pre><pre>the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to</pre><pre>refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.</pre><pre>&nbsp;</pre><pre>If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under</pre><pre>any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to</pre><pre>apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other</pre><pre>circumstances.</pre><pre>&nbsp;</pre><pre>It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any</pre><pre>patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any</pre><pre>such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the</pre><pre>integrity of the free software distribution system, which is</pre><pre>implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made</pre><pre>generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed</pre><pre>through that system in reliance on consistent application of that</pre><pre>system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing</pre><pre>to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot</pre><pre>impose that choice.</pre><pre>&nbsp;</pre><pre>This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to</pre><pre>be a consequence of the rest of this License.</pre><pre>&nbsp;</pre><pre>  8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in</pre><pre>certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the</pre><pre>original copyright holder who places the Program under this License</pre><pre>may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding</pre><pre>those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among</pre><pre>countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates</pre><pre>the limitation as if written in the body of this License.</pre><pre>&nbsp;</pre><pre>  9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions</pre><pre>of the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will</pre><pre>be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to</pre><pre>address new problems or concerns.</pre><pre>&nbsp;</pre><pre>Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program</pre><pre>specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and &quot;any</pre><pre>later version&quot;, you have the option of following the terms and conditions</pre><pre>either of that version or of any later version published by the Free</pre><pre>Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of</pre><pre>this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software</pre><pre>Foundation.</pre><pre>&nbsp;</pre><pre>  10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free</pre><pre>programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author</pre><pre>to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free</pre><pre>Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes</pre><pre>make exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals</pre><pre>of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and</pre><pre>of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.</pre><pre>&nbsp;</pre><pre>                           NO WARRANTY</pre><pre>&nbsp;</pre><pre>  11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY</pre><pre>FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN</pre><pre>OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES</pre><pre>PROVIDE THE PROGRAM &quot;AS IS&quot; WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED</pre><pre>OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF</pre><pre>MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS</pre><pre>TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE</pre><pre>PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,</pre><pre>REPAIR OR CORRECTION.</pre><pre>&nbsp;</pre><pre>  12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING</pre><pre>WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR</pre><pre>REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,</pre><pre>INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING</pre><pre>OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED</pre><pre>TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY</pre><pre>YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER</pre><pre>PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE</pre><pre>POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.</pre><pre>&nbsp;</pre><pre>                    END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS</pre><pre>&nbsp;</pre><pre>            How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs</pre><pre>&nbsp;</pre><pre>  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest</pre><pre>possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it</pre><pre>free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.</pre><pre>&nbsp;</pre><pre>  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest</pre><pre>to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively</pre><pre>convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least</pre><pre>the &quot;copyright&quot; line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.</pre><pre>&nbsp;</pre><pre>    &lt;one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.&gt;</pre><pre>    Copyright (C) &lt;year&gt;  &lt;name of author&gt;</pre><pre>&nbsp;</pre><pre>    This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify</pre><pre>    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by</pre><pre>    the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or</pre><pre>    (at your option) any later version.</pre><pre>&nbsp;</pre><pre>    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,</pre><pre>    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of</pre><pre><span
lang=EN-GB>    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the</span></pre><pre><span
lang=EN-GB>    GNU General Public License for more details.</span></pre><pre><span
lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></pre><pre><span lang=EN-GB>    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License</span></pre><pre><span
lang=EN-GB>    along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software</span></pre><pre><span
